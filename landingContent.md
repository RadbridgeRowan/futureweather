# Landing Page Content Extraction

## Hero Section

**Layout:** A two-column layout. The left side contains the main heading, a descriptive paragraph, and call-to-action buttons. The right side features a background image, which is masked to fade in from the left.

**Content:**

- **Heading:** Design for Future Weather
- **Paragraph:** Create future weather files for building, solar, and data center simulations. Validated method, rapid results, API-ready.
- **Buttons:** "Try it Free" and "Learn More".
- **Promotional Message:** Get 1 free job credit when you sign up

## Overview Section

**Layout:** A single column of text.

**Content:**

- **Heading:** Overview
- **Paragraph 1:** Future Weather is a simple, fast, and integration‑ready platform for generating future climate‑adjusted weather files (EPW, DDY, STAT) for building performance modeling and other planning or simulation tools that require weather file inputs.
- **Paragraph 2:** Built in partnership with the academic creator of the original Future Weather Generator, Dr. Eugénio Rodrigues, our morphing pipeline has been extensively tested against the original tool across thousands of scenarios and matches results. It also includes enhanced features such as greater flexibility in selecting future periods, an intuitive web interface, and an API for programmatic access.

- **Paragraph 3:** If you're modeling a facility that will be around for the next 20 years or more then you've come to the right place. Whether you want to optimize costs, reduce liability, comply with regulations, conduct research - or you're just curious about how your facility will perform in the future - incorporating future weather files into your workflow can enhance your outcomes.

## How It Works Section

**Layout:** A three-column grid, similar to the Benefits section. Each column represents a step in a process and includes an icon, a numbered sub-heading, and descriptive text.

**Content:**

- **Heading:** How it works
- **Step 1:**
  - **Icon:** Map pin
  - **Sub-heading:** 1. Choose location and scenario
  - **Paragraph:** Select a location, upload your EPW file, pick a future period, climate scenario, and climate model(s).
- **Step 2:**
  - **Icon:** CPU chip
  - **Sub-heading:** 2. Generate future weather file
  - **Paragraph:** We run your EPW file through our morphing pipeline and incorporate climate data to adjust each variable.
- **Step 3:**
  - **Icon:** Document file
  - **Sub-heading:** 3. Download, store, or integrate
  - **Paragraph:** Download EPW (and optional DDY/STAT) immediately or come back and download it later.

## [idea for above - some kind of stopwatch that shows only 15 seconds has passed between step 2 and 3?]
